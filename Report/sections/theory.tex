\subsection{Magnification and resolution}
To measure the resolution we can use different methods such Rayleigh's criterion, modulation transfer function and point spread function. 
% A digital image has it's dimension in pixels and the resolution of digital images is the dimension of an image in pixels.
% The ratio between image and object size is known as the magnification for an optical system. 
% MTF Ratio between input and output modulation.
