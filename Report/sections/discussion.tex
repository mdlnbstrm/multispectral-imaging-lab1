%discussion     ...we removed the last row because we wanted the matrices on the same format to be able to use subtraction. When we do the subtraction I1-I2 we will get the frames of the objects in the image. This is because of when we subtract each pixel with it's neighbor we will only se black if the two have the same color, and if the two pixels have different values, like the edge of the car and the background next to the car, we will see the frame of our object when the pixels are going from lighter to darker.


%grey values blabla function mesh shows different depths depending on what colour the pixels have
