Digital images are stored as matrices containing data for what colour each pixel has. There are many different ways to analyze digital images, in this laboratory work we will see how to find the resolution of the image, experiment with different perspectives and how we can detect if something has changed in the image. We will also experiment using IR camera to detect what kind of material we can detect heat through.
